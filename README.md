## About

The `cpp11qpdf` package provides a set of functions to manipulate PDF
files using the `qpdf` library.

## Installation

You can install the development version of cpp11qpdf like so:

tmpdir <- tempdir()
library(cpp11qpdf)
file <- file.path(Sys.getenv("R_DOC_DIR"), "NEWS.pdf")
pdf_compress(file, file.path(tmpdir, "output.pdf"))
#> [1] "/tmp/RtmpNx4LFI/output.pdf"
```
